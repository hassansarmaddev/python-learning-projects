Welcome back, what is a file? 
It's just a collection of data 
saved on a hard disk or other storage that persists over time.
A file has a name, 
and files can be organized into folders or directories.
We'll be working with text files as opposed to images or 
sounds or videos. Here, we have an example of a 
file called olympics.text that is available to us 
in Runestone. 
Each line has information about
one athlete's participation 
in the Olympics. It's actually 
a simulated file. Runestone can't access the real 
files on your computer for security and privacy reasons. 
So we simulate the presence of 
a few files in the Runestone environment so we can 
illustrate how file reading works. Python provides 
some functions for reading data from an existing file. 
There are two steps. First, 
you call the open function to open the file.
